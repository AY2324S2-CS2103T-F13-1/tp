# TAPro User Guide

TAPro is a **Contact Book application** that is made for Computer Science Tutors for managing their students contact and attendance details.

TAPro is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

If you can type fast, TAPro can get your contact management and attendance taking tasks done **faster** than traditional GUI apps.

<span class="semi-bold">Only the name is searched.</span>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> `E01234567` will not match a student with NUSNet ID `E01234567`.

<box type="success" seamless>

<span class="semi-bold">The order of the keywords does not matter.</span>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`

<box type="success" seamless>

<span class="semi-bold">Only full words will be matched.</span>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> `Han` will not match `Hans`

### Autocomplete

Autocompletes a word or a set of words, based on the current input.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Autocomplete doesn't work on week number:**

This is because week number is short,
and it is much faster just typing out the number.

</box>

<box type="success" seamless>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span>

We have three students with NUSNet IDs `e0123456`, `e1234567` and `e2345678`. 
If we type `mark nn/` into the command input box and press <span class="badge bg-light text-dark">Tab</span>,
we can see that the text in the command input box autocompletes to become `mark nn/e01234567`.

Pressing <span class="badge bg-light text-dark">Tab</span> again, causes the text to update to `mark nn/e1234567`,
followed by `mark nn/e2345678`.
</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Using autocomplete to scroll through all possible autocomplete suggestions:**

Autocomplete will scroll through all possible options, based on the existing data in your contact list.

When reaching the end of the possible options list, pressing
<span class="badge bg-light text-dark">Tab</span> will wrap 
the possible options back to the start of that list again.
</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Sorted autocomplete suggestions:**

The autocomplete suggestions will be listed in alphabetical order, meaning if you have two possible options
`abc` and `abd`, autocomplete will give `abc` before `abd`.
</box>

<markdown class="d-print-none">---</markdown>

### Retrieving command history

TAPro saves successful commands input, so you can retrieve them later, using the 
<span class="badge bg-light text-dark">Up</span> and
<span class="badge bg-light text-dark">Down</span> keys.

<box type="success" seamless>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span>

We have entered `mark nn/e0123456` as the previous command, and it was successful. Now the command input box is empty.

Pressing <span class="badge bg-light text-dark">Up</span> will update the text in the command input box to
the previous command `mark nn/e0123456`.
</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Only successful commands will be retrieved:**

If you enter an invalid command, it will not appear when attempting to retrieve it.
</box>

<markdown class="d-print-none">---</markdown>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<br>

### Saving the data

TAPro's data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

<markdown class="d-print-none">---</markdown>
<br>

### Editing the data file

TAPro's data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**

If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TAPro will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>

Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TAPro to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

<i class="fa-regular fa-circle-question"></i>
**Q:** How do I transfer my data to another computer?

<i class="fa-regular fa-comment-dots"></i>

## Known issues


<box type="warning" theme="danger" seamless>

**1. When using multiple screens**

If you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
