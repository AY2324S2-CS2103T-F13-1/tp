We have three students with NUSNet IDs `e0123456`, `e1234567` and `e2345678`. 
If we type `mark nn/` into the command input box and press <span class="badge bg-light text-dark">Tab</span>,
we can see that the text in the command input box autocompletes to become `mark nn/e01234567`.

Pressing <span class="badge bg-light text-dark">Tab</span> again, causes the text to update to `mark nn/e1234567`,
followed by `mark nn/e2345678`.
</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Using autocomplete to scroll through all possible autocomplete suggestions:**

Autocomplete will scroll through all possible options, based on the existing data in your contact list.

When reaching the end of the possible options list, pressing
<span class="badge bg-light text-dark">Tab</span> will wrap 
the possible options back to the start of that list again.
</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Sorted autocomplete suggestions:**

<span class="badge bg-light text-dark">Down</span> keys.

<box type="success" seamless>

We have entered `mark nn/e0123456` as the previous command, and it was successful. Now the command input box is empty.

Pressing <span class="badge bg-light text-dark">Up</span> will update the text in the command input box to
the previous command `mark nn/e0123456`.

**Caution:**

If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TAPro will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>

Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TAPro to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

**1. When using multiple screens**

If you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
