**TAPro is a desktop application for Computer Science tutors to manage their students' contact and attendance details.**
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using TAPro, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing TAPro, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
