## **Design**

This section describes the design of various components of TAPro.

<br>

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of TAPro.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

<br>

#### Main components of the architecture

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of TAPro's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of TAPro.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command and autocomplete executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of TAPro in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<br>

#### How the architecture components interact with each other

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user 
issues the command `delstu nn/E1234567`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<box type="success" light>

**#g#Example:##**

The `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. 

Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class, as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

<box type="tip" light>

<span class="semi-bold">Reason:</span> To prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component.
</box>
</box>

The sections below give more details of each component.

{{ newPage }}

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

**The `UI` component,**

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

{{ newPage }}

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="800"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delstu nn/E1234567")` API 
call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delstu e1234567` Command" />

<box type="info" light>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

**How command execution works in `Logic` component:**

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<br>

**How autocomplete execution works in `Logic` component:**

1. When `Logic` is called upon to autocomplete an input string, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn matches the input and return the corresponding autocomplete object (e.g. `AutoCompleteCommand`).
1. This results in a `AutoComplete` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AutoCompleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The autocomplete object is solely responsible for generating the autocomplete suggestions based on the input string (e.g. the additional characters that can be appended to the input string).
1. The result of the autocompletion is simply a string that autocompletes the input string. Autocomplete classes uses [Trie](#trie) under the hood to efficiently generate the autocomplete suggestions.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/><br><br>

**How the parsing works:**
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
  * All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
* When called upon to parse an autocomplete input, the `AddressBookParser` class checks whether the input contains arguments. If it does not contain arguments, it creates an `AutoCompleteCommand` object which autocompletes Commands. Otherwise, it checks for the last argument in the user input and creates the matching `AutoComplete` object if it exists (e.g. `arbitrary_command arg_a/arbitrary_arg` lead to the `AutoCompleteArgA` object, if it exists). Otherwise, a default `AutoComplete` object that always return an empty string is returned.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" /><br><br>

**The `Model` component,**
* stores the contact book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" light>

**An alternative model:**

An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

{{ newPage }}

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" /><br><br>

**The `Storage` component,**
* can save both contact book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

{{ newPage }}

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

<br>

#### Trie

The `Trie` class is a data structure that allows for efficient prefix matching of strings. It is used in the `AutoComplete` feature to suggest completions for user input.

We added the ability to search for the first word that matches a given prefix. This is useful for the autocomplete feature, where we want to suggest the first word that matches the prefix.

{{ newPage }}

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<markdown class="d-print-none">---</markdown>
<br>

### Autocomplete Feature

**TODO**

{{ newPage }}

### Command History Retrieval

**TODO**

{{ newPage }}

### \[Proposed\] Undo/Redo Feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current contact book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous contact book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone contact book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial contact book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single contact book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" /><br><br>

**Step 2.** The user executes `delstu nn/E1234567` command to delete student with NUSNet ID as E1234567 from the contact book. 
The `delstu` 
command 
calls 
`Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the contact book after the `delstu nn/E1234567` command 
executes to 
be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted contact book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" /><br><br>

**Step 3.** The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified contact book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" light>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the contact book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box><br><br>

**Step 4.** The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous contact book state, and restores the contact book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" /><br><br>

**Step 5.** The user wants to set the course name. He enters the command `setcrs CS2103T`, causing the course name to appear on the main window's title.


<box type="info" light>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial `AddressBook` state, then there are no previous `AddressBook` states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" light>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the contact book to that state.

<box type="info" light>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest contact book state, then there are no undone `AddressBook` states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box><br><br>

**Step 6.** The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the contact book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" /><br><br>

**Step 7.** The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all contact book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" /><br><br>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire contact book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delstu`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Design Decisions**

1. **Why does `edit` command use `INDEX` as identifier instead of `NUSNET`?**
    1. For our users, using `edit nn/E0123456 nn/E1234567` is unintuitive to edit the NUSNet ID of a student.
    1. `INDEX` is visually easier to reference and requires less effort to type.
    1. The alternative solution we considered was to disallow editing of `NUSNET`, but this would be a limitation on
       the user's freedom, or would necessitate that the user deletes the student and re-enter all the details again.

   **Note:** `delstu` command uses `NUSNET` as identifier because it requires more intentional effort and
   therefore ensures that the TA intends to perform this dangerous action.
