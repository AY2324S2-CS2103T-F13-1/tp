## **Design**

This section describes the design of various components of TAPro.

<br>

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of TAPro.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

<br>

#### Main components of the architecture

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of TAPro's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of TAPro.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command and autocomplete executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of TAPro in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<br>

#### How the architecture components interact with each other

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user 
issues the command `delstu nn/E1234567`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<box type="success" light>

**#g#Example:##**

The `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. 

Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class, as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

<box type="tip" light>

<span class="semi-bold">Reason:</span> To prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component.
</box>
</box>

The sections below give more details of each component.

{{ newPage }}

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

**The `UI` component,**

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

{{ newPage }}

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="800"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delstu nn/E1234567")` API 
call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delstu e1234567` Command" />

<box type="info" light>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

**How command execution works in `Logic` component:**

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<br>

**How autocomplete execution works in `Logic` component:**

1. When `Logic` is called upon to autocomplete an input string, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn matches the input and return the corresponding autocomplete object (e.g. `AutoCompleteCommand`).
1. This results in a `AutoComplete` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AutoCompleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The autocomplete object is solely responsible for generating the autocomplete suggestions based on the input string (e.g. the additional characters that can be appended to the input string).
1. The result of the autocompletion is simply a string that autocompletes the input string. Autocomplete classes uses [Trie](#trie) under the hood to efficiently generate the autocomplete suggestions.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/><br><br>

**How the parsing works:**
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
  * All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
* When called upon to parse an autocomplete input, the `AddressBookParser` class checks whether the input contains arguments. If it does not contain arguments, it creates an `AutoCompleteCommand` object which autocompletes Commands. Otherwise, it checks for the last argument in the user input and creates the matching `AutoComplete` object if it exists (e.g. `arbitrary_command arg_a/arbitrary_arg` lead to the `AutoCompleteArgA` object, if it exists). Otherwise, a default `AutoComplete` object that always return an empty string is returned.

{{ newPage }}

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" /><br><br>

**The `Model` component,**
* stores the contact book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" light>

**An alternative model:**

An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

{{ newPage }}

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" /><br><br>

**The `Storage` component,**
* can save both contact book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

{{ newPage }}

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

<br>

#### Trie

The `Trie` class is a data structure that allows for efficient prefix matching of strings. It is used in the `AutoComplete` feature to suggest completions for user input.

We added the ability to search for the first word that matches a given prefix. This is useful for the autocomplete feature, where we want to suggest the first word that matches the prefix.

{{ newPage }}

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<markdown class="d-print-none">---</markdown>
<br>

### Autocomplete Feature

**TODO**

{{ newPage }}

### Command History Retrieval

**TODO**

{{ newPage }}

### \[Proposed\] Undo/Redo Feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current contact book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous contact book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone contact book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial contact book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single contact book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" /><br><br>

**Step 2.** The user executes `delstu nn/E1234567` command to delete student with NUSNet ID as E1234567 from the contact book. 
The `delstu` 
command 
calls 
`Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the contact book after the `delstu nn/E1234567` command 
executes to 
be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted contact book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" /><br><br>

**Step 3.** The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified contact book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" light>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the contact book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box><br><br>

**Step 4.** The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous contact book state, and restores the contact book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" /><br><br>

**Step 5.** The user wants to set the course name. He enters the command `setcrs CS2103T`, causing the course name to appear on the main window's title.


<box type="info" light>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial `AddressBook` state, then there are no previous `AddressBook` states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" light>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the contact book to that state.

<box type="info" light>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest contact book state, then there are no undone `AddressBook` states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box><br><br>

**Step 6.** The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the contact book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" /><br><br>

**Step 7.** The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all contact book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" /><br><br>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire contact book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delstu`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Design Decisions**

<br>

1. **Why does `edit` command use `INDEX` as identifier instead of `NUSNET`?**
    1. For our users, using `edit nn/E0123456 nn/E1234567` is unintuitive to edit the NUSNet ID of a student.
    1. `INDEX` is visually easier to reference and requires less effort to type.
    1. The alternative solution we considered was to disallow editing of `NUSNET`, but this would be a limitation on
       the user's freedom, or would necessitate that the user deletes the student and re-enter all the details again.
    
   <br>
   <box type="info" light>

   **Note:** `delstu` command uses `NUSNET` as identifier because it requires more intentional effort and
   therefore ensures that the TA intends to perform this dangerous action.
   </box>
   <br>

1. **Why does autocomplete sort in [ASCIIbetical order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Character_order) and not normal alphabetical order?**
   1. The only difference ASCIIbetical order has from normal alphabetical order, is that uppercase letters are ordered before lowercase letters.
   2. For most parameters this doesn't make a difference, due to case-insensitivity or validation checks that enforce a certain format.
   3. But for the tag parameter, `TAG`, it is case-sensitive, so `LATE` and `late` are two different tags.
   4. A user can use uppercase for emphasis and to give priority to that tag, in the autocompletion order, thus allowing the user to autocomplete a certain tag more easily, and without much hassle.

    <br>
    <box type="success" light>

    **#g#Example:##** If a user uses the following tags: `LATE`, `early`, `onTime`, to tag their students based on their latest submission, then `LATE` would appear before `early` and `onTime` in the autocompletion of a blank tag parameter.
     </box>

   5. The alternative solution we considered was to use normal alphabetical ordering, but this meant that there would not be priority given to uppercase tags, without explicitly adding a number before that tag, which is less intuitive.
   6. Another alternative solution we considered was to allow the user to set the priority of the values in the autocompletion, but this meant adding unnecessary verbosity to the command format, which may not be that intuitive for new users.
   <br><br>
     
1. **Why does autocompletion only give values that are already present instead of predicting the next result?**
   1. It is performance intensive to predict the next autocompletion based on all possible values.
   2. It will also use up significant storage space to store the possible autocompletions, which would not meet the application size requirements required for this course.
   3. Moreover, autocompletion of certain unused words may be redundant, as not all words would be even used.
   4. Hence, we decided to just perform autocompletion based on the available values that are stored in TAPro, as it increases the usefulness of this feature in this context.

   <br>

1. **Why does autocomplete not work when the command input box is empty?**
   1. The alternative solution we considered is when the command input box is empty, autocomplete scrolls through all possible commands. However, it has a few issues.
   2. It is much faster typing out the first few letters of the command you want to autocomplete, and then autocompleting, since regular users would remember the commands to use.
   3. If it was a new user, then the new user would refer to help and our user guide instead of using the autocomplete to see what options there are.
   4. Moreover, for the new user, the autocomplete feature may be confusing at first, so by omitting autocomplete on an empty input, it prevents accidental misunderstandings on what {{ macros.keyFormat('Tab') }} should do.
   5. Furthermore, we do not want new users to execute a command without understanding what it did first, as it may cause irreversible data loss (`clear` command). We wanted a new user to understand the command, by referring to help or our user guide on what a command did, in order to prevent a situation where data is accidentally lost.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

5. **Why are placeholder values valid input?**
    1. There is no simple way to edit a student's optional attribute back to the default without the using placeholder value (`X not provided`, where X is the attribute), without having to perform two commands: delete the student and add back the student if a value was incorrectly filled when it is not available to the user.
    2. With autocompletion, a user can easily fill in the placeholder value, so it is much easier to set an attribute back to the placeholder value.

    <br>
    <box type="success" light>

   **#g#Example:##** If a user doesn't have all phone numbers, then the parameter value `Phone number not provided` may be a possible value that they will use later on, and so the autocomplete helps make the process easier for the user to reset the value if necessary.
   </box>

    3. Hence, we allowed the placeholder value as valid input to serve this purpose.
    4. The alternative solution we considered was to leave the parameter value empty to set it back to the default, but there is an issue with it. Users may accidentally set the parameter value as empty, resulting in the accidental lost of an attribute's value.
    5. As there is no way to undo this change easily, we decided to use the placeholder value for this purpose, so that in order to reset an attribute, the user has to intentionally want to do so, by typing out the full placeholder value (`X not provided`, where X is the attribute).

   <br>
   <box type="success" light>

   **#g#Example:##** Assuming we used the alternative solution, if a user inputs `edit 1 p/` and accidentally presses enter, then the phone number of the student at index 1 in the user's contact list would be erased to `Phone number not provided`.

   Although this was the user's accidental mistake, it resulted in the user needing to do more work to restore back the change. Hence, we decided to use the placeholder value, so that the user will be less likely to accidentally reset an attribute by mistake.
   </box>

    6. Furthermore, autocomplete has placeholder values present only when they are necessary, which helps against accidentally removing an optional attribute of a student.

    <br>
    <box type="success" light>

   **#g#Example:##** Usually, if a user would store all phone numbers or no phone numbers at all, depending on their needs.

   If a user has all phone numbers present, then the parameter value `Phone number not provided` would not be available as an autocompletion, to prevent accidental lost of a student's phone number by mistake.
   </box>
   <br>

6. **Why does command history toggle only retrieve successful commands?**
   1. The alternative we considered was to store the history of all command inputs.
   2. However, unsuccessful command inputs are not that helpful to a user, and it only clutters up a user's command history, resulting in more time wasted searching for a successful command input.
   3. Hence, storing only successful command inputs in the command history enabled users to be more efficient at using TAPro.

## **Appendix: Effort**

As a team, we have conquered many problems and fought uphill battles. We did away a number of potential headaches with improved workflows and use of automation.

Below are some non-exhaustive instances of our challenges, achievements and efforts overcoming them.

1. Utilised Nunjucks macros and variables in documentation.
   Macros were used for creating `newPage` breaks as well as when replacing key button presses like {{ macros.keyFormat
   ('Tab') }}, {{ macros.keyFormat('âŒ˜Cmd') }} and
   {{ macros.keyFormat('Alt') }}. While macros are powerful tools for reusing code with parameters, variables in 
   Nunjucks 
   serve as placeholders that can dynamically insert content, such as implementing page breaks efficiently. 

    This method abstracts the formatting into a 
   single, manageable location, ensuring uniformity across our documentation. It streamlines the documentation process, making it easier for contributors to apply custom styling and formatting without getting bogged down by repetitive tasks. 
    
    For further information and a deeper understanding of how we utilize Nunjucks in our documentation, you can visit the Nunjucks official documentation for [Macros](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#macro) and [Variables](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#variables).

1. Refactored the parameter syntax to improve AB3's original OOP.

1. Implemented autocomplete and command history.
   We thought hard about what are the potential shortcuts that would save our target user's time and we looked to 
   the CLI for inspiration. Given that our product uses NUSNet ID as its unique identifier, it can be a hassle to 
   type out a full command. Especially when it has already been previously used, or only require minor changes to 
   the command. This resulted in the idea of clicking {{ macros.keyFormat
   ('Tab') }} for autocomplete when allowed as well as <span class="badge bg-light text-dark"><i class="fa-regular 
   fa-square-caret-up"></i> UP</span> and <span class="badge bg-light text-dark"><i class="fa-regular 
   fa-square-caret-down"></i> DOWN</span> arrow keys to retrieve previous commands.

1. Utilised [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and installed [MarkBind](https://markbind.org/) locally as a 
   dev-dependency in `package.json`. It allows us to serve documentation on our local machines, and ensures that all developers are using the same version of MarkBind for consistency, so that no version related issues of MarkBind result in inconsistencies in our codebase.

1. Utilised [`captain-githook`](https://github.com/swellaby/captain-githook) `pre-commit` and `pre-push` checks 
   locally to automatically verify if code changes made will pass continuous integration checks. It allows us to focus our time on working on the quality of our code, rather that dealing with formatting related issues.

1. Utilised Trie data structure for optimizing the performance of TAPro, especially in terms of autocompletion 
   functionality, recognizing the need for rapid and efficient search capabilities. Tries are exceptionally well-suited for autocomplete systems, as they allow for the quick retrieval of full words based on partial inputs, dramatically improving our application's responsiveness during user searches.

1. Utilised caching to further enhance the performance and user experience of TAPro's autocompletion feature.
