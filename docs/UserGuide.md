TODO: Add a screenshot of the GUI with annotations


## <i class="fa-solid fa-forward"></i> Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your computer.

<box type="info" light>

<i class="fa-solid fa-download"></i>
**Installing Java:**


If you do not have Java 11 or above installed, you can download the latest available version of Java from [here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/downloads/). 

For macOS users, you may wish to follow the instructions [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/admin/programmingLanguages.html).

</box>

2. Download the latest version of `TAPro.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TAPro.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you downloaded the JAR file in, and run the `java -jar TAPro.jar` command to launch the application.

<box type="info" light>

A GUI similar to the below image should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

<img alt="Main Window UI on first launch" src="images/main_window_ui.png" class="rounded-image" width="738px"/>

</box>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


5. Type a command in the command input box and press {{ macros.keyFormat('Enter') }} to execute it. 


<box type="success" light>

**#g#Example:##** Typing **`help`** in the command input box and pressing {{ macros.keyFormat('Enter') }} will open the help window.
</box>
<box type="success" light>

**Here are some example commands you can try:**

* `list` : Lists all contacts.

* `addstu nn/E0952224 n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com m/Computer Science` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to the contact book.

* `delstu nn/NUSNET` : Deletes the student with the specified `NUSNET` from the contact book.

* `exit` : Exits the application.

</box>

6. Refer to the sections under [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

{{ newPage }}

## <i class="fa-solid fa-font-awesome"></i> Features

<box type="info" light>

**About the command format:**<br>

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.</span>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> In `addstu n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addstu n/John Doe`.
</box>


<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">Items in square brackets are optional.</span>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
</box>

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.</span>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
</box>


<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">Parameters can be in any order.</span>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> If the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.
</box>

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.</span>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> If the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
</box>

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">Non-recognized prefixes be parsed as part of the previous parameter's value.</span>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> If the command specifies `addstu n/John Doe a/Non-recognized-prefix`, it would be parsed as `NAME` parameter being `John Doe a/Non-recognized-prefix`, instead of just `John Doe`, as `a/` is not a [recognized prefix](#parameters-and-their-recognized-prefixes).
</box>

</box>

<box type="warning" light>

<i class="fa-solid fa-file-lines"></i>
**When using a PDF version of this document:**

Be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</box>

{{ newPage }}

### <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i> Viewing help : `help`

Entering the `help` command opens a help window that shows a message explaining how to access the help page,
as well as quick reference of each command with simple examples on how to use them.

<box type="definition" icon=":fa-solid-spell-check:" light>

**Format: `help`**
</box>
<box type="info" light>

<i class="fa-regular fa-window-restore"></i>
**A new window is opened:**

A new window is opened, so that it does not clutter up your main window. A GUI similar to the below image should appear.

<img src="images/help_window_ui.png" alt="Help Window UI" class="rounded-image" width="730px"/>

</box>

<box type="info" light>

**More about help's quick reference:**

The quick reference is meant for {{ macros.semiBold('fast and reliable') }} lookup of commands and their usages, without needing an internet connection and opening a browser to get an overview of the commands.

* It is not meant to contain detailed information about each command. To access detailed information about each command, you can refer to our user guide.
  </box>

<box type="tip" light>

<i class="fa-solid fa-maximize"></i>
**Resizing the help window:**

The help window is resizable, so you can {{ macros.semiBold('easily reposition and resize') }} it to fit anywhere on your screen, exactly where you want it to be.
</box>

<box type="tip" light>

<i class="fa-solid fa-window-restore"></i>
**Switching quickly between the help and main window:**

* On Windows and most Linux distributions, you can use the keyboard shortcut: {{ macros.keyFormat('Alt') }} + {{ macros.keyFormat('Tab') }}, to switch between windows quickly.

* On macOS, you can use the keyboard shortcut: {{ macros.keyFormat('âŒ˜Cmd') }} + {{ macros.keyFormat('`') }}, to switch between windows quickly.
  </box>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Name/Rename CS course : `setcrs`

Sets the course code in question.

Course is shown at the top of the window.

<box type="definition" icon=":fa-solid-spell-check:" light>

**Format: `setcrs COURSE_CODE`**
</box>

<box type="info" light>

Course codes are case-insensitive.

</box>

Here is the output in the command results when the `setcrs` command is successful:


<box type="warning" light>

Course code should follow the format "XX1234Y", Y is optional.


When an invalid course code is entered, the following error message appears:

</box>

{{ newPage }}


### <i class="fa-solid fa-user-plus"></i> Adding a student: `addstu`
Adds a student to the contact book.

<box type="definition" icon=":fa-solid-spell-check:" light>

**Format: `addstu n/NAME nn/NUSNET [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [m/MAJOR] [t/TAG]â€¦â€‹`**
</box>

* Adds a student with the given details.

* The name and NUSNet ID must be provided, as they are not optional parameters.

* And NUSNet ID must be unique.

<box type="info" light>

**Case-insensitivity of NUSNet ID:**

NUSNet ID is case-insensitive, and it will be converted to uppercase automatically upon running the command.

For example, `e0123456` will be converted to `E0123456`, as `E0123456` and `e0123456` refer to the same NUSNet ID.
</box>

* Name must not be empty (or spaces only), and must have single spaces between words. It must be in proper-case and contain only alphabets.

<box type="warning" light>

**Adding un-permitted names:**

In the current version of TAPro, certain names are not permitted due to the strictness of name validation. 

The current workaround is to follow the proper-case format and make slight changes to the name, so that the validation works.

<box type="success" light>

{{ macros.semiBold('#g#Example:##') }} For names like `Zubir bin Said` and `Balaji s/o Sadasivan`, we can make slight changes to the name to fit current permitted formats. 
They become `Zubir Bin Said` and `Balaji So Sadasivan` after the change, which are still similar enough to the original to not cause confusion.
</box>
</box>

* All the remaining fields are optional. If values are not provided to optional fields, they will be set to a placeholder value under the hood (e.g., `Major not provided` for `MAJOR` field).

<box type="info" light>

**Any number of tags:**

A student can have any number of tags, including 0.
</box>
<box type="success" light>

**Alphanumeric tags**

{{ macros.semiBold('#g#Example:##') }} `bestFriend4Ever`, `colleague`, `Club` are valid tags, but `best friend`, `best-friend` are not valid tags.
</box>
<box type="tip" light>

**Adding multiple majors:**

If a student is undertaking a double degree programme, you can use a comma to separate the disciplines in the `MAJOR` field.

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> We can use `m/Computer Science, Mathematics` to indicate that a student has these two majors, Computer Science and Mathematics.
</box>
</box>

<box type="success" light>

**#g#Examples:##**

* `addstu n/John Doe nn/E1234567 p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com m/Computer Science`

* `addstu n/Betsy Crowe nn/E0123456 t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com m/Mathematics, Physics p/1234567 t/club`

* `addstu n/Betsy Crowe nn/E0123456`
  </box>

{{ newPage }}

### <i class="fa-solid fa-list-ul"></i> Listing all students : `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the contact book.

<box type="definition" icon=":fa-solid-spell-check:" light>

**Format: `list`**
</box>

If there are additional arguments behind `list` we will simply ignore them.

{{ newPage }}

### <i class="fa-solid fa-user-pen"></i> Editing a student : `edit`

Edits an existing student in the contact book.

<box type="definition" icon=":fa-solid-spell-check:" light>

**Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [m/MAJOR] [nn/NUSNET] [t/TAG]â€¦â€‹`**
</box>

* Edits the student at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list. The index **must be a positive integer**, such as 1, 2, 3, â€¦â€‹

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.

* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

* When editing tags, the existing tags of the student will be removed, i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.

* You can remove all the studentâ€™s tags by typing `t/` without
  specifying any tags after it.

<box type="warning" light>

When `t/` is specified in the command, no other tags can be present, in order to remove all of a student's tag. 

Otherwise, TAPro will parse the input as adding multiple tags, which may lead to an unsuccessful execution of the command.

<box type="success" light>

**#g#Example:##** Entering `edit 1 t/abc t/` will cause the error message `Tags names should be alphanumeric` to be shown. This error message is shown because TAPro expects the second `t/` to contain an alphanumeric value, which an empty value is not.
</box>
</box>

<box type="success" light>

**#g#Examples:##**

*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email contact of the first student to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the second student to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.
   </box>
   <box type="info" light>

This command differs from most other commands that uses `NUSNET` to identify a student. This command uses the index number shown in the displayed person list to identify the student to be edited.
</box>

{{ newPage }}

### <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> Locating students by name: `find`

Finds students whose names contain any of the given keywords.

<box type="definition" icon=":fa-solid-spell-check:" light>

**Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]â€¦â€‹`**
</box>
<box type="info" light>

**Parameters of `find` command:**

Both `KEYWORD` and `[MORE_KEYWORDS]â€¦â€‹` accept alphanumeric and special symbols as their supplied value, and are separated by spaces when supplied.

* `KEYWORD` is the first keyword to search for. This is a compulsory parameter.

* `[MORE_KEYWORDS]â€¦â€‹` are additional, optional keywords to search for. You can have any number of additional keywords.

</box>

<box type="info" light>

**About the `find` command:**

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">Only the name is searched.</span>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> `E01234567` will not match a student with NUSNet ID `E01234567`.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-wand-magic-sparkles"></i> Autocomplete

The autocomplete feature autocompletes a parameter or command, based on the current command box input and the current data in TAPro. This means that if an attribute value is not present, it will not be present in the autocompletion of that corresponding parameter.

{{ macros.definitionBox('Autocompletion', 'The autocomplete feature\'s suggested result(s).') }}

We can autocomplete both command names and parameters after their prefixes by pressing {{ macros.keyFormat('Tab') }}, when an autocompletion is available.

<box type="important" light>

**Autocompletes the first word as a command name:**

The first word, will be autocompleted as a command name, instead of a parameter, if an autocompletion can be found for the current word that is in the command box input.

<box type="warning" light>
<span class="semi-bold">The command input box must not be empty</span> for autocomplete to work.
</box>

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span>

We have three students with NUSNet IDs `E0123456`, `E1234567` and `E2345678`.
If we type `mark nn/` into the command input box and press {{ macros.keyFormat('Tab') }} ,
we can see that the text in the command input box autocompletes to become `mark nn/E01234567`.

Pressing {{ macros.keyFormat('Tab') }}  again, causes the text to update to `mark nn/E1234567`,
followed by `mark nn/E2345678`.
</box>

<box type="info" light>

If we type `a` into the command input box and press {{ macros.keyFormat('Tab') }}, we see that the text in the command input box autocompletes to become `addstu`.

The last parameter `TAG` is autocompleted.
</box>
</box>

<box type="important" light>

**Autocompletes the last parameter in the input:**


Autocomplete works on the last parameter (if any) in the command box, which is the text directly after a [recognized prefix](#parameters-and-their-recognized-prefixes).


<box type="warning" light>

A parameter can only be autocompleted if it is not the first word, and has a [recognized prefix](#parameters-and-their-recognized-prefixes).
</box>

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span>

We have some students in TAPro, such that the first tag alphabetically is `friends`.
If we type `edit 1 n/John Doe t/` into the command input box and press {{ macros.keyFormat('Tab') }},
we see that the text in the command input box autocompletes to become `edit 1 n/John Doe t/friends`.

The last parameter `TAG` is autocompleted.
</box>
</box>
{{ newPageBetween }}

<box type="info" light>

**Autocomplete scrolls through all autocompletions:**

Autocomplete will scroll through all possible suggestions, based on the existing data in your contact list.

When reaching the end of the all possible suggestions, pressing {{ macros.keyFormat('Tab') }} will wrap
the possible options back to the start of that list again.

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span>

We have three students with NUSNet IDs `E0123456`, `E1234567` and `E2345678`.
If we type `mark nn/` into the command input box and press {{ macros.keyFormat('Tab') }},
we can see that the text in the command input box autocompletes to become `mark nn/E0123456`.

Every press of {{ macros.keyFormat('Tab') }}, causes the command input box text to update to the next autocompletion:
* from `mark nn/E0123456` to `mark nn/E1234567`,
* then to `mark nn/E2345678`,
* and then back to `mark nn/E0123456`.
  </box>
  </box>

<box type="warning" light>

**Autocomplete is omitted on week number.**

Autocomplete does not work for week number, because `WEEK` is at most two digits, so it is much faster just typing out the number.
</box>

<box type="tip" light>

**Sorted autocompletions:**

The autocompletions will be listed in [ASCIIbetical order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Character_order), which is when all uppercase letters come before lowercase letter, and digits and most punctuations come before letters.

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span>
If we have only the following tags in our contact list: `abc`, `123` `BCD`, `234`, `bcd`, autocompleting a `TAG` will give autocompletions in this order: `123`, `234` `BCD`, `abc`, `bcd`.

</box>
</box>

<box type="tip" light>

**Quickly clear an attribute with autocomplete:**

We can autocomplete the placeholder value, if it is present for that parameter in our contact list. When a placeholder value is inputted as the parameter, it means that attribute for that student will be reset, after entering the command.

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span>

If the placeholder for the `MAJOR` parameter, `Major not provided`, is present in the contact list, then in the autocompletion for the `MAJOR` parameter, the value `Major not provided` is available.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i> Editing the data file

TAPro's data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" light>

**Invalid data file format:**

If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TAPro will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>

Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TAPro to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

<box type="info" icon=":fa-solid-question:" light>

**Q:** <span class="semi-bold">Long names, phone numbers, emails and majors are truncated in the UI. Why does TAPro not make these text wrap around?</span>

**A:**  By [international standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164), telephone numbers should not exceed 15 digits. And typical names and email addresses are rarely too long, which falls outside of normal use cases. Lastly, most students will have no more than 2 majors. So under any normal use case, the fields will not contain texts long enough to be truncated. Having a single line of text for each field also ensures the UI remains clean and uncluttered.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> Known issues

<box icon=":fa-solid-bolt:" theme="danger" light>

**1. Using multiple screens**

If you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
</box>

<box icon=":fa-solid-bolt:" theme="danger" light>

**2. Having more than one instance of TAPro running**

If you have more than one instance of TAPro running, the application may not function as expected. TAPro's data will desynchronise. The remedy is to close all instances of TAPro and run only one instance of TAPro.
</box>

<box icon=":fa-solid-bolt:" theme="danger" light>

**3. When the data file is in an invalid format**

If you [edit the data file](#editing-the-data-file) into an invalid format, upon the next launch of TAPro, no error message would be shown, and all data will be discarded. The remedy is to store a backup of your data file before modifying it, to prevent the loss of data.
