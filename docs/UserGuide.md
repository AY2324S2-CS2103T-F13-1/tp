## <i class="fa-solid fa-forward"></i> Navigating the GUI

Welcome to the TAPro GUI! ðŸŽ‰ Here's a quick tour to help you get comfortable with the interface:

TODO: Add a screenshot of the GUI with annotations


## <i class="fa-solid fa-forward"></i> Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your computer.

<box type="info" light>

<i class="fa-solid fa-download"></i>
**Installing Java:**

If you do not have Java 11 or above installed, you can download the latest available version of Java from [here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/downloads/).
The latest version is compatible with older versions.

</box>

2. Download the latest version of `TAPro.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TAPro.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you downloaded the jar file in, and run the `java -jar TAPro.jar` command to launch the application.

<box type="info" light>

A GUI similar to the below image should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

<img alt="Main Window UI on first launch" src="images/main_window_ui.png" class="rounded-image" width="738px"/>

</box>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

5. Type the command in the command box and press {{ macros.keyFormat('Enter') }} to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing {{ macros.keyFormat('Enter') }} will open the help window.

<box type="info" light>

**Here are some example commands you can try:**

* `list` : Lists all contacts.

* `addstu nn/E0952224 n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com m/Computer Science` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to the contact book.

* `delstu nn/NUSNET` : Deletes the student with the specified `NUSNET` from the contact book.

* `clear` : Deletes all students, and their contact and attendance information.

* `exit` : Exits the application.

</box>

6. Refer to the sections under [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

<br>

## <i class="fa-solid fa-font-awesome"></i> Features

<box type="info" light>

**About the command format:**<br>

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.</span>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> In `addstu n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addstu n/John Doe`.
</box>


<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">Items in square brackets are optional.</span>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
</box>

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.</span>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
</box>


<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">Parameters can be in any order.</span>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> If the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
</box>

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.</span>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> If the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
</box>

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">Non-recognized prefixes be parsed as part of the previous parameter's value.</span>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> If the command specifies `addstu n/John Doe a/Non-recognized-prefix`, it would be parsed as `NAME` parameter being `John Doe a/Non-recognized-prefix`, instead of just `John Doe`, as `a/` is not a [recognized prefix](#recognized-prefixes-for-attributes).
</box>

</box>

<box type="warning" light>

**If you are using a PDF version of this document:**

Be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</box>

<img src="images/help_window_ui.png" alt="Help Window UI" class="rounded-image" width="800px"/>

</box>

<box type="info" light>

**More about help's quick reference:**

The quick reference is meant for **fast and reliable** lookup of commands and their usages, without needing an internet connection and opening a browser to get an overview of the commands.

* It is not meant to contain detailed information about each command. To access detailed information about each command, you can refer to our user guide.
</box>

<box type="tip" light>

<i class="fa-solid fa-maximize"></i>
**Resizing the help window:**

The help window is resizable, so you can **easily reposition and resize** it to fit anywhere on your screen, exactly where you want it to be.
</box>

<box type="tip" light>

<i class="fa-solid fa-window-restore"></i>
**Switching quickly between the help and main window:**

* On Windows and most Linux distributions, you can use the keyboard shortcut: {{ macros.keyFormat('Alt') }} + {{ macros.keyFormat('Tab') }}, to switch between windows quickly. 

* On macOS, you can use the keyboard shortcut: {{ macros.keyFormat('âŒ˜Cmd') }} + {{ macros.keyFormat('`') }}, to switch between windows quickly.

<box type="info" light>
**Tip:** A person can have any number of tags (including 0)
</box>

<box type="info" light>
**Note:** NUSNet ID is case-insensitive, and it will be converted to uppercase automatically upon running the command. (e.g., `e0123456` will be converted to `E0123456`)
</box>

<box type="tip" light>
**Tip:** If a student is undertaking a double degree programme, you can use a comma to separate the disciplines in the `MAJOR` field. (e.g., `m/Computer Science, Mathematics`)
</box>

Examples:
* `addstu n/John Doe nn/E1234567 p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com m/Computer Science`

    specifying any tags after it.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email contact of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

<box type="info" light>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-wand-magic-sparkles"></i> Autocomplete

The autocomplete feature autocompletes a parameter or command, based on the current command box input and the current data in TAPro. This means that if an attribute value is not present, it will not be present in the autocompletion of that corresponding parameter.

{{ macros.definitionBox('Autocompletion', 'The autocomplete feature\'s suggested autocomplete result(s).') }}

We can autocomplete both command names and parameters after their prefixes by pressing {{ macros.keyFormat('Tab') }}, when an autocompletion is available.

<box type="important" light>

**Autocompletes the first word as a command name:**

The first word, will be autocompleted as a command name, instead of a parameter, if an autocompletion can be found for the current word that is in the command box input.

<box type="warning" light>
<span class="semi-bold">The command input box must not be empty</span> for autocomplete to work.
</box>

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span>

We have three students with NUSNet IDs `e0123456`, `e1234567` and `e2345678`. 
If we type `mark nn/` into the command input box and press <span class="badge bg-light text-dark">TAB</span>,
we can see that the text in the command input box autocompletes to become `mark nn/E01234567`.

Pressing <span class="badge bg-light text-dark">TAB</span> again, causes the text to update to `mark nn/E1234567`,
followed by `mark nn/E2345678`.
</box>

<box type="info" light>
If we type `a` into the command input box and press {{ macros.keyFormat('Tab') }}, we see that the text in the command input box autocompletes to become `addstu`.

The last parameter `TAG` is autocompleted.
</box>
</box>

<box type="important" light>

**Autocompletes the last parameter in the input:**

Autocomplete works on the last parameter (if any) in the command box, which is the text directly after a [recognized prefix](#recognized-prefixes-for-attributes). 

When reaching the end of the possible options list, pressing
<span class="badge bg-light text-dark">TAB</span> will wrap 
<box type="warning" light>
A parameter can only be autocompleted if it is not the first word, and has a [recognized prefix](#recognized-prefixes-for-attributes).

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span>

We have some students in TAPro, such that the first tag alphabetically is `friends`.
If we type `edit 1 n/John Doe t/` into the command input box and press {{ macros.keyFormat('Tab') }},
we see that the text in the command input box autocompletes to become `edit 1 n/John Doe t/friends`.

The last parameter `TAG` is autocompleted.
</box>
</box>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<box type="info" light>

**Autocomplete scrolls through all autocompletions:**

Autocomplete will scroll through all possible suggestions, based on the existing data in your contact list.

When reaching the end of the all possible suggestions, pressing {{ macros.keyFormat('Tab') }} will wrap 
the possible options back to the start of that list again.

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span>

We have three students with NUSNet IDs `E0123456`, `E1234567` and `E2345678`.
If we type `mark nn/` into the command input box and press {{ macros.keyFormat('Tab') }},
we can see that the text in the command input box autocompletes to become `mark nn/E0123456`.

Every press of {{ macros.keyFormat('Tab') }}, causes the command input box text to update to the next autocompletion: 
* from `mark nn/E0123456` to `mark nn/E1234567`,
* then to `mark nn/E2345678`, 
* and then back to `mark nn/E0123456`.
</box>
</box>

<box type="warning" light>

**Autocomplete does not work on week number.** This is because `WEEK` is at most two digits, so it is much faster just typing out the number.
</box>

<box type="tip" light>

**Sorted autocompletions:**

The autocompletions will be listed in [ASCIIbetical order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Character_order), which is when all uppercase letters come before lowercase letter, and digits and most punctuations come before letters.

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span>
If we have only the following tags in our contact list: `abc`, `123` `BCD`, `234`, `bcd`, autocompleting a `TAG` will give autocompletions in this order: `123`, `234` `BCD`, `abc`, `bcd`.

</box>
</box>

<box type="tip" light>

**Quickly clear an attribute with autocomplete:**

We can autocomplete the placeholder value, if it is present for that parameter in our contact list. When a placeholder value is inputted as the parameter, it means that attribute for that student will be reset, after entering the command.

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span>

If the placeholder for the `MAJOR` parameter, `Major not provided`, is present in the contact list, then in the autocompletion for the `MAJOR` parameter, the value `Major not provided` is available.

### Launching TAPro
<box type="info" icon=":fa-solid-question:" light>

**Q**: How can I launch TAPro if clicking on the JAR file does not work?<br>
**A**: There are two possible methods to launch TAPro.

**Method 1**: Using the Command Terminal 
1. Open the command line in your operating system's terminal software.
2. Navigate to the directory where the JAR file is located.
3. Enter `java -jar TAPro.jar` and the TAPro Application should launch.

**Method 2**: Using `.bat/.sh` Scripts
   1. Create a new text file and paste the following code into the file and edit it according to the comments:
      ```sh
         java -jar <abosute_path_to_TAPro.jar> 
      ```
      Replace "<abosute_path_to_TAPro.jar>" with the path to TAPro on your system, in quotes.<br>
      Example on Windows: `java -jar "C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Downloads\TAPro.jar"`<br>
      Example on Linux: `java -jar /home/YOUR_USERNAME/Downloads/TAPro.jar`<br>
   Example on macOS: `java -jar "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Downloads/TAPro.jar"`<br>

2. Save the file as `TAPro.bat` (Windows) or `TAPro.sh` (macOS/Linux).
3. Change the admin settings of the script to allow it to run as a program:
    - Windows: Right-click on the script and select Properties. Under General, check the box that says `Allow this file to run as a program`.
    - macOS/Linux: Open the Terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located. Type `chmod +x <script_file_name>` and press `Enter`.<br>Note: (`chmod +x` changes permissions of the script to allow it to be executed)

<box type="info" icon=":fa-solid-question:" light>

**Q**: Can I add tags to a TAPro contact if I want to remember something additional, like a birthday?<br>
**A**: Yes you can! In fact, you may use the `TAG` parameter of a contact to store any information you want. Simply 
use `edit` with the `NUSNET` of the student and the information you wish to add to the contact, and you should be on your way!

<box type="success" light>

<span class="semi-bold">#g#Example:##</span> Using tag as a birthday for contacts
```

</box>

<box type="warning" light>

**Caution:**

Do note that as of the current version of TAPro, you can only add one tag to a contact. Adding a new tag will 
replace the existing tag.

Do also note that tags are alphanumeric and cannot contain spaces or special characters.

</box>
</box>

<box type="info" icon=":fa-solid-question:" light>

**Q:** Long names, phone numbers, emails and majors are truncated in the UI. Why does TAPro not make these text wrap around?<br/>
**A:**  By [international standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164), telephone numbers should not exceed 15 digits. And typical names and email addresses are rarely too long, which falls outside of normal use cases. Lastly, most students will have no more than 2 majors. So under any normal use case, the fields will not contain texts long enough to be truncated. Having a single line of text for each field also ensures the UI remains clean and uncluttered.
</box>


### Saving More Time
<box type="info" icon=":fa-solid-question:" light>

**Q**: How can I save more time when using TAPro?<br>
**A**: You can use the advanced features like **[autocomplete](#autocomplete)** and **[command history toggle](#retrieving-command-history)** in TAPro!

features are 
designed to help you input commands faster and more efficiently.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> Known issues

<box type="warning" theme="danger" light>

**1. When using multiple screens**

If you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
</box>

<box type="warning" theme="danger" light>

**2. If you have more than one copy of TAPro running**

If you have more than one copy of TAPro running, the application may not function as expected. TAPro's data will desynchronise. The remedy is to close all instances of TAPro and run only one instance of TAPro.
</box>

<box type="warning" theme="danger" light>

**3. When data file is in an invalid format**

If you [edit the data file](#editing-the-data-file) into an invalid format, upon the next launch of TAPro, no error message would be shown, and all data will be discarded. The remedy is to store a backup of your data file before modifying it, to prevent the loss of data.
